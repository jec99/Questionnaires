parts

1. diffusion maps
2. nearest neighbor search
3. trees with haar wavelets
	2a. later: with sum and difference operators
	2b. later: multiple trees
4. earth mover's distance on trees?


settings/functions that are needed:
1. 2-means tree construction (dyadic with pmax=0)
	dyadictree function
2. correlation initial + sensor iterate + points iterate
	partition_localgeometry
3. get dual geometry similarity matrix
	dual_geometry, partition_dualgeometry
4. get top eigenvectors/eigenvalues
	ncut (regularization + eigensolve)

main reserach goal: solve the subspace clustering with irrelevant
features problem, but with irrelavancies depending on the subspace
